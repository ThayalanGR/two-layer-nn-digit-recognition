For example, number of neurons in incoming layer is 784, then weights should be initialized randomly in uniform interval between [-1/784^0.5, 1/784^0.5].

        You should maintain a list of weights and biases which will be initalized here. They should be torch tensors.

        Optionally, you can maintain a list of activations and weighted sum of neurons in a dictionary named Cache to avoid recalculation of those. If tensors are too large it could be an issue.
